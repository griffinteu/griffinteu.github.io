        <h2><a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a></h2>
            
        <p>I really like the apple website because I feel as it is modern and up to date. The code is clean and moderns using html elements. From what I can find they do not use any tables.  The layout is simple and easy to navigate with everything you might need displayed inline across the top. In addition, there is a search button that will help you find more niche items. There are videos and moving aspects of the website that give it its modern almost futuristic feel. The main colors are black and white with a pop of bright colors on the products that make them stand out. The colors perfectly match what they are trying to sell, modern innovations. I think a little thing that really stands out on the apple website is when you are scrolling things will appear as you scroll that weren’t really there at first. </p>
        
        <h2> <a href="https://www.nike.com/" target="_blank">Nike</a></h2>
            
        <p>Nike is also an example of a great up to date website. What I really like about the website is that right now the first thing you see when you open it up is a big video of Lebron James that spans across the screen. This really sets the mood for what Nike is about and the message they are trying to promote. The code is a little messier and more extensive than Apple’s, but it does appear to be modern using html elements. From what I can see there was no tables being used. The layout is very clean with a simple menu across the top of the screen with the addition of a search bar making the website very easy to navigate. Again, similar to Apple, Nike’s website colors are mostly black and white with pop of color for the products and pictures. I think this provides a clean modern feel and embraces what Nike is trying to do. One thing I really like about this website is the use of all the photos. They have a ton of photos that showcase famous athletes that wear their brand. I think this is a great thing to highlight on the website as it will motivate people to buy. </p>
        
        <h2> <a href= "https://www.lingscars.com/" target="_blank">LINGsCARS</a></h2>
        
        <p>This is the terrible website. While I actually love this website, objectively this is a horrible, outdated website. First off, there is too much going on, on this website. It is overly crowded and too many things are moving around. Not to mention not all of the links’ work. Additionally, as you scroll down there is a blank white section that adds no value to the website that is just as big as the part of the website with substance.  The code is virtually non-existent from what I can tell. When I click on inspect nothing shows up, so I am not sure what that means. The layout really doesn’t make a lot of sense as there is just so much that is going on. This makes navigating the website hard and confusing and finding what you are looking for is not easy. Every color known to man is being used on this website, which I think can take away from the purpose it is trying to serve which is selling cars. In the end though, while this is an objectively terrible website, I love it. I think it is hilarious and I would personally trust Ling and maybe even buy a car from them. </p>
