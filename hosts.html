  <h2>My Recommendation</h2>
        
        <p> I personally would recommended GoDaddy as they have the cheapest plan that offers almost as much as BlueHost. WP Engine was in a realm of its own and not really comparable to the other two hosting sites. Blue Host seems like it would be cheaper, but looking deeper you see that they charge more after the first month. Go daddy is upfront with their prices, offer free domain, and is great for any size of business. </p>
