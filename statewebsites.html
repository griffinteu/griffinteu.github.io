        <h2> <a href="https://alaska.gov/" target="_blank">Alaska</a></h2>
            
        <p>Personally, I like the colors and designs of the website. I it mostly blue and white with a lake and mountain range in the background. I really like the background as it really illustrates the outdoors and what Alaska is about. The website loaded very quickly, probably less than or around 0.5 seconds if I were to guess. The menu is super easy to navigate and straight forward. There is an easily accessible search bar in the top right of the website that makes looking for things on the website easy. The website works great on mobile size as the menu turns into a drop-down menu and you can find everything that was displayed inline on the larger version.  I will say that the website feels a bit outdated and not very modern. Some of the photos and texts are just old. In fact, down near the bottom where the social media is available there is an old twitter logo and when you click on it, it says twitter, meaning the website definitely is not updated within the last couple of years.

        <h2> <a href="https://portal.arkansas.gov/" target="_blank"> Arkansas </a></h2>
            
        <p>This website definitely seemed more up to date and modern. It had moving slides of photos and animations of a waving hand where you could type in any question that you have. In addition to that the colors were variants of blue that keep it clean and professional. Not to mention near the bottom there is a video of the outdoors in Arkansas. This website is very appealing to the eye. The menu was in the top right-hand corner of the website and made it very easy to navigate the website. On a smaller mobile screen, the menu turns into three lines in the top right-hand corner that you can click on that give you access to everything you could access on the larger screen. It did however seem to make the video stop playing when I turned it into a smaller size. My only critic is that maybe there was a little too much going on with all the moving parts, animations, photos, and video. Overall, this was a great looking website that was easy to navigate and appealing. RANK 2</p>
        
        <h2> <a href="https://portal.kansas.gov/" target="_blank">Kansas</a></h2>
        
        <p>This website was by far my favorite of the five. It was clean, concise, loaded quickly, and easy to navigate. This website used colors of blue, white, and a reddish orange maintaining a clean professional look. The menu was in line at the top middle of the screen and turned into three lines in the middle of the screen to click on when it was in a small mobile mode. It included a search bar and live chat ensuring that you could find the answer to whatever you need.  The website didn’t have too much going on like the Arkansas one did and had just enough when it came to photos and designs.  Some things I really liked about this website is the fact it had a phone number and ours of operation right at the top of the screen. I didn’t have to go searching for it like I did on other sites.

          <h2> <a href="https://www.maine.gov/portal/index.html" target="_blank">Maine</a></h2>
        
        <p>This website was appealing to the eye with a pretty picture of the state’s capital building boldly displayed across the site. The website loaded really quick; I have no complaints about it. The menu is on the upper right side of the screen inline with each other. I think it looks clean and it was super easy to navigate. Displayed front and center of the website was a search bar. I liked that the search bar was right there, making it easy to find what you are looking for quickly. In a mobile size the menu goes to the top left corner of the screen, turning into three lines that when clicked on gibe you access to everything you could access on the desktop size. I do think this website was also a little outdated, something about the photos they used and the top display bar felt old to me. RANK 3</p>
        
          <h2> <a href="https://www.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Maryland</a></h2>
        
        <p>This was by far my least favorite website out of the five. The colors used were red, black, white, and yellow. While this does represent the states colors, I hated how the video that was played in the background was covered by a red tint. I thought it made the website look drastically worse and almost dull. The menu was also on the right side of the screen going down which I did not like. I prefer the menu to span across the top of the screen. I did like how the search bar was in the middle and easily accessible. In a mobile size the menu turns into three lines in the top left corner and the red tint and video go away. It actually looked much better in the mobile size and was just as easy to navigate when it was larger. This website also loaded slower than all the other ones. RANK 5</p>
